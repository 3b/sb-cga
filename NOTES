* Version 1.0
*** TODO Porting
    Who woulda thunk people want to port this?
***** Guidelines & Principles
******* No #+sbcl #-sbcl in source files that exist for other reasons than portability.
******* Nikodemus will not maintain portability: SBCL port will be the canonical one.
******* Uglified code is allowed in shared files if it makes things faster for SBCL.
******* Uglified code is not allowed in shared if it makes code faster for implementation X.
	(Put it in an implementation specific file instead.)
***** DONE add ports/sbcl.lisp
******* DONE Add file to build with feature dep.
******* DONE define SB-CGA::DEFKNOWN as an empty wrapper around SB-C:DEFKNOWN, etc.
***** DONE add ports/<other-impl>.lisp
      These files will define appropriate versions of SB-CGA::DEFKNOWN, etc.
***** DONE restructure vm1.lisp & vm2.lisp for portability
      Probably add vm-<impl>.lisp which should contain the DEFINE-VOP
      equivalents, so that the load-order would be something like
      fndb.lisp (defknowns for the whole system), vm-<impl>.lisp
      (define-vop equivalents for ports that have them),
      vm-common.lisp (stuff in vm2.lisp, mostly).
***** TODO Switch to plain RT or another test framework.
***** TODO Rename to CL-CGA, maybe
      Iff there are at least two ports with maintainers that use them
      and will probably continue to do so.
*** DONE Defsystem
*** DONE Defpackage
*** TODO Manual
***** TODO Format & docstring extraction.
***** TODO Writing
******* TODO Overview
       	What SB-CGA is and isn't. What sort of things may change if you use
       	the repo directly. Design choises relating to single/double floats.
******* TODO Vectors
******* TODO Matrices
******* TODO Root solvers
******* TODO Constants
*** TODO Miscellany

*** TODO VEC
***** DONE VEC type
***** TODO Additional operations
******* DONE NORMALIZED-VEC
******* DONE NORMALIZED-CROSS-PRODUCT
******* TODO NORMALIZED-TRANSFORM-POINT
	The reason these seem worthwhile is that they avoid memory
	traffic -- but it is probably not a good idea to expose
	them as part of the interface!

*** DONE Compiler macros to transform nested operations for less consing.
*** TODO Consider bang-style public API
* Version 2.0
*** TODO Separate transform type, used double-floats in matrices.
*** TODO Variable arity in vector arithmetic without memory traffic for intermediate results
